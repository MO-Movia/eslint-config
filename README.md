# Modus Operandi eslint-config

## Description

This package contains the core coding standards for all MO apps.

## Requirements

Before you can start using the eslint-config your application must have the following dev-dependencies associated with your apps version of Angular:

- `eslint`
- `angular-eslint` (for Angular projects only)

## Installation & Setup

1. Run `npm i -D @modusoperandi/eslint-config` to install the package as a dev dependency.
   If using Angular, follow the [Angular ESLint instructions](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint) to enable Linting with ESLint, and make sure `angular-eslint` is installed.
   1. Remove all eslint dependencies aside from eslint and angular-lint from your dev-dependencies.
2. Copy `eslint.config.cjs` and `.prettierrc.yml` from this repo to the root of your project, and remove excess comments.
3. Change `mo` to the prefix of your Angular app/lib, or remove that line if this isn't an Angular project.
4. Run `ng lint` (Angular) or `eslint` (Basic) in a script to ensure functionality. Add `--max-warnings=0` to make these rules strict, or `--quite` to ignore warnings.

You may use a different Prittier config for your project, but the one in this project is recommended. It is recommended to limit edits to the prettierrc to compatibility reasons, and to respect the stylistic defaults.

### Optional

1. Add the .gitattributes from this project to your project to prevent End Of Line (EOL) issues in your repo.
2. If you are using VSCode, Make sure you have the following extensions that help with these rules.

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) (you may need to turn on "use flat config" setting)
- [Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template)
- [SonarLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode)
- (for strict) [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## Migrating from v1 to v2

1. Do steps 2 + 3 from the setup.
2. Change 'mo' in the config file to the prefix you are using for your Angular app/lib if necessary. The prefix overrides are part of the shared config.
3. If you have any rule overrides aside from the 2 Angular prefix rules, add them as shown [here](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/shareable-configs#overriding-settings-from-shareable-configs) in accordence with the new ESLint flat config.
4. Delete your old eslint config file.

## Migrating from v2 to v3

1. Config is now required and requires specifying a copyright header, with an optional project license.
1. For the license value, if provided, it is recommended to use the short name of the license, or `See LICENSE file at root of project`.
1. If not provided, `@license` will still be included in the header as some compilers know to preserve the header comment when it is present. (ex, the Angular compiler)

## Usage Notes

1. `console.log(...)` should be avoided. These are usually forgotten debug statements, and when theyâ€™re not, their overuse can spam the logs hiding actual errors.
   It is recommended to use [ngx-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-logger) instead so that logging behavior can be controlled at the app layer.
   `console.warn(...)` and `console.error(...)` are ok to use though if necessary.
2. Mocking libraries are designed to be typescript friendly. If a mock library ever returns "any" as a type, that usually means you forgot to specify a type somewhere.
3. `() => {}` is commonly used for a "noop" function. However, `{}` looks like an empty object, and semantically empty function blocks are usually an unintended bug. use `() => undefined` instead to make the noop clear, or `() => ({})` if you intended to return an empty object.
4. [import/no-extraneous-dependencies](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/blob/main/docs/rules/no-extraneous-dependencies.md)
   means you're importing something that isn't declared in your package.json, and my not get installed if your dependencies of dependencies change.
   These packages need to be added to your peerDependencies or dependencies to protect you and your consumers.
5. The set of import rules that restrict absolute paths, cycles, and useless path segments are there to protect your code base from a variety of edge cases
   that can cause compile/runtime issues for you or your consumers.
6. "http://" can always be avoided. For URLs, you should always default to "https". For URIs like xml schemes, you should use an imported constant or parameter instead to avoid typos.
7. The header config requires file headers to start with `@license` and `@copyright`, but you can include addition things after that like `@file`.
8. For the header copyright config, you can use `const fs = require('node:fs')` (or `const fs = require('fs')` which is friendlier to Visual Studio Code) to load the copyright text from a file with `fs.readFileSync('./COPYRIGHT.md', 'utf-8')`.
9. For strict mode, it is recommended to use more performant/safe regex libraries for non-trivial regex to avoid ReDOS (Regex Denial Of Service) issues.
